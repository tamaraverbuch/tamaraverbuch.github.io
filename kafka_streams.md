# 🚀 Kafka Streams

Stream processing with the Kafka Streams API.

## Overview
Kafka Streams is a client library for building real-time streaming applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters.

## Key Concepts
- **KStream**: A stream of records from Kafka topics.
- **KTable**: A changelog stream from a primary-keyed table.
- **Stateless and Stateful Processing**: Kafka Streams supports both stateless (map, filter) and stateful operations (aggregate, join).

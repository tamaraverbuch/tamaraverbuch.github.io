# üìÇ Compression Techniques

Techniques for compressing data to reduce storage space and improve processing speed, including GZIP, Snappy, and LZ4.

## GZIP
GZIP is a widely used compression tool that reduces file size for fast file transmission and storage savings.

## Snappy
Snappy is a fast compression and decompression library developed by Google, optimized for high-speed performance.

## LZ4
LZ4 is a fast, lossless compression algorithm that provides high throughput, especially suited for real-time data compression.

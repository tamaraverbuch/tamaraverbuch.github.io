# üìÇ JSON and Binary Formats

Overview of JSON, MessagePack, Protobuf, and Thrift, which are commonly used formats for data serialization.

## JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data format that's easy to read and write.

## MessagePack
MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format that enables data to be both small in size and quick to deserialize.

## Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
Protobuf is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data, developed by Google.

## Thrift
Apache Thrift is a scalable cross-language service development framework that enables efficient serialization and communication across various programming languages.

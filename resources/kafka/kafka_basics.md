# ðŸš€ Kafka Basics

Introduction to Kafka, its architecture, and key components.

## What is Kafka?
Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It is often used for real-time data pipelines, streaming analytics, and event-driven systems.

## Key Components
- **Topics**: Categories to which records are published in Kafka. Producers send data to topics, and consumers read from topics.
- **Producers and Consumers**: Producers send data to Kafka topics, while consumers read data from those topics.
- **Partitions**: Each topic is divided into partitions, enabling distributed processing.
- **Brokers and Clusters**: Kafka runs on a cluster of servers known as brokers, providing scalability and fault tolerance.

# ðŸš€ Kafka Producer/Consumer

Overview of producing and consuming messages in Kafka.

## Producers
Producers send data to Kafka topics. A producer assigns messages to specific partitions within a topic.

## Consumers
Consumers read data from Kafka topics. Consumers in the same group share the work of consuming messages in a topic.
